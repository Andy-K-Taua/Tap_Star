This project was my second project at GA. I will continuously be revisiting this website to update new features.

I used:-

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Ruby on Rails

===========================

Features:-

Model 1 - User:
The user can:
- log in
- log out
- Sign in as a new user > confirmation password user authentication.

Model 2 - Places:
The user can:
- add a place
- delete a place
- edit a place

Model 3 - Photos
The user can:
- add a photo to a place
- rate the the photo

===========================

Known Bugs:

CSS buttons require a standard location


===========================

Future Features:

I would like to add a feature to the places model with Geocode that will allow the user to search an actual address and add it.

I would also like to add Cloudinary to the uploading of images so that the user can upload their pictures live.  

I would also like to make this app mobile responsive.
